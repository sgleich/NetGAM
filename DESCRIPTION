Description: The functions available in this package apply a generalized 
    additive mixed model (gamm)-based data transformation to microbial species 
    abundance data. This data transformation can be applied to microbial 
    abundance counts prior to carrying out an ecological network analysis with
    time-series data to ensure that seasonal and long-term time-series 
    features do not lead to spurious or inaccurate connections in downstream
    network analyses. The NetGAM data transformation method is designed to 
    capture and remove monthly, long-term, and autocorrelative trends from 
    microbial abundance data and is therefore not optimized for time-series 
    data that are not collected at monthly sampling intervals.
